# Introduction-to-ML
This repository contains the course materials, my solutions and my projects for the "Introduction to Machine Learning" course.

## Notebooks
- `1_How to Solve a Machine Learning Task.ipynb`
linear regression implementation and calculation of mean deviation
- `2_Exploratory data analysis.ipynb`
manipulations with dataframes via Pandas and data visualisation via seaborn
- `3_Factor Preparation.ipynb`
covers encoding categorical factors, target encoding, standardization, and correlation analysis
- `4_Selecting and creating a model.ipynb`
covers sections on Perceptron and Multilayer Perceptron.
- `5_Quality_assesment.ipynb` 
demonstrates data splitting, cross-validation, error analysis for quality assessment, and bootstrap for confidence interval estimation.
- `6_Model Parameter Tuning.ipynb`
explores techniques including grid search, bisection method, gradient descent, and simulated annealing for parameter tuning and model optimization.
- `7_Regression problem. Linear regression.ipynb`
covers linear regression with two parameters, essential linear algebra concepts, and extends to multiple linear regression.
