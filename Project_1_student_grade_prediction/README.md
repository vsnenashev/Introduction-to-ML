# Student Grade Prediction with Linear Regression

This project utilizes linear regression models to predict the final grades of students based on various factors. It leverages a dataset containing information on the academic performance of 395 students from two Portuguese schools during the 2005â€“2006 academic year.

## Project Structure

- `Student_grade_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `student-mat.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset with information on student performance in mathematics.

## Dataset Description

The dataset includes a comprehensive set of factors that describe each student. These factors may include demographic information, family background, study habits, and previous academic performance.
